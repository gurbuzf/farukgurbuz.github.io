I am a Water Resources Engineer. I graduated from Istanbul Technical University as a Civil Engineer in 2016. I received my Master's degree in the field of Water Resources Engineering from the University of Iowa in 2020. 

I am interested in hydrological modelling for streamflow forecasting, Machine Learning(ML) applications in hydrology, Geographic Infromation Systems (GIS) and developing state-of-the-art strategies for reservoir control. I am currently working at General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works(DSI), Turkiye. Coding and doing research about my profession are among my best leisure-time activities. 


An interesting fact about me is that I am a professional beekeper. :honeybee:

I am a `Water Resources Engineer` and `Software Developer`. I graduated from Istanbul Technical University with a bachelor's degree Civil Engineering in February 2016. I received my Master's degree in Water Resources Engineering from the University of Iowa in December 2020. 

I am interested in hydrological modeling for streamflow forecasting, Machine Learning(ML) applications in hydrology, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and Hydro-informatics. I have been working at `Turkish State Hydraulic Works(DSI)` since February 2021. I am employed at the Observations Division of DSI. My responsibility is to build hydro-informatics tools to visualize hydro-meteorological data in real-time and access historical data.

Coding and doing research about my profession are among my best leisure-time activities. An interesting fact about me is that I am a professional beekeeper.
